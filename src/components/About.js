            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is a zero-player game created by British mathematician John Conway. It is a cellular automaton which produces wildly varying outcomes based on changes to the initial state, all based on a small set of simple rules. Conway's Game of Life is turing complete, which means that a sufficiently large enough grid may perform the same calculations of which computers are capable using a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">emergent patterns.</a></p>
